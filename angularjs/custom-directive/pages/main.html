    <!--This is the child, the directive was able to access its parent scope by default. The directive can affect the data in the
    parent scope, it could be dangerous. Angularjs provides a method to isolate the directive, the model part of the directive for the 
    model form of the html that contains the directive. This is called isolate scope. To isolate the scope we define a property scope in
    the directive.
    I'm creating a hole in the directive with attribite person-name and I'm saying person.name its the value from my scope -->
